# Python Programming Solutions

This repository contains simple Python programs written by me as part of my practice exercises.  
All the programs take input from the user and display the output on the console.

## ðŸ“‚ Programs in this repository

1. **Count of Vowels and Consonants**  
   File: `count of vowels and consonants.py`  
   - Takes a string from the user  
   - Counts how many vowels and consonants it has  
   - Prints the counts separately  

2. **Count the Frequency of Each Character**  
   File: `count the frequency of each character in a string.py`  
   - Reads a string from the user  
   - Counts how many times each character appears  
   - Displays the character along with its frequency  

3. **Palindrome Check**  
   File: `palindrome or not.py`  
   - Accepts a number from the user  
   - Checks whether it is a palindrome number  
   - Prints the result  

4. **Remove Spaces from a String**  
   File: `removing spaces from a string.py`  
   - Takes a sentence or word from the user  
   - Removes all the spaces from it  
   - Displays the modified string  

5. **Reverse a String (without built-in functions)**  
   File: `reversed string without buit-in function.py`  
   - Takes a string as input  
   - Reverses it manually without using slicing or built-in reverse functions  
   - Shows the reversed string
   - # Python Programs on Numbers

This repository contains simple Python programs to perform basic operations on numbers, such as checking for prime numbers, calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci series, summing digits, and reversing digits.

## Programs Included in python programs on numbers

1. **Prime Number Check**  
   - Takes a number as input and checks if it is prime.  
   - A prime number has only two factors: 1 and itself.

2. **Factorial of a Number**  
   - Calculates the factorial of a given number.  
   - Factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Fibonacci Series**  
   - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.  
   - Starts with `0` and `1`, and each term is the sum of the previous two.

4. **Sum of Digits**  
   - Calculates the sum of all digits in a given number.  
   - Example: `123 â†’ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

5. **Reverse of a Number**  
   - Reverses the digits of a given number.  
   - Example: `123 â†’ 321`


Example Output

1. Enter a number: 7
 Prime Check: Yes, it's a prime number
2. Enter a number: 5
 Factorial of 5 is: 120
3.  Enter how many terms of Fibonacci you want: 5
   Fibonacci Series:
    0 1 1 2 3
4. Sum of digits of 5 is: 5
5. Reversed number is: 5


## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  
2. Save the file as `python programs on numbers.py`.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the fileâ€™s directory.  
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python "python programs on numbers.py"

## ðŸ“Œ Note
- All programs are written in a beginner-friendly way.
- They are intended for practice and understanding of basic Python concepts like loops, conditions, and string handling.
